# Available projects

#### Here you will find a list of available projects. The one which are strike-through are unavailable (meaning that the have been already taken)
##### Feel free to come with any project proposal and we will review it together. _*NO*_ documentation will be needed, however, the requirements will be discussed together and will be formalized in a nice document and linked to this list.
##### There will (hopefully) be no more than 1 (or max 2) people on the same assignment. 
##### Group assignments are "a thing" but will be more difficult and thoroughly checked. :warning: 

######More assignments will be posted as soon as I get some new ideas...
